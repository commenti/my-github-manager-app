/**
 * Explains, in plain language, what the app does and does not do with the
 * user's data:
 *  - GitHub repo owner/name and Personal Access Token are processed and
 *    stored locally on-device only (token is encrypted at rest); nothing
 *    is sent to any server owned by this app or its developer.
 *  - The app shows ads via Google AdMob, which may collect data per its
 *    own policy, independent of the GitHub-related data above.
 *
 * @param onDismiss Invoked when the dialog is dismissed — by tapping
 *                  "Close", tapping outside the dialog, or pressing back.
